## 🧭 Overview

**STAT41130: AI for Weather and Climate** is a hands-on course designed to introduce students to machine learning methods for weather and climate applications.  
It combines manual “AI by Hand” exercises, Python coding, and real-world datasets to build understanding from basic linear regression through to modern neural networks and the ECMWF Anemoi framework.

The course bridges meteorology and artificial intelligence — ideal for students from both backgrounds who want to explore AI methods for forecasting, modelling, and data-driven science.

## 🌦️ The Anemoi Framework

This course uses ECMWF’s **Anemoi** system — a modular ecosystem for machine learning in weather forecasting.

- **anemoi-graphs** – define graph structures for models  
- **anemoi-models** – provides neural network architectures (GNNs, Transformers, etc.)  
- **anemoi-training** – handles data loading, model training, and distributed computing  

Students will explore these packages using simple examples before scaling to larger datasets.

## 💡 Learning Philosophy

This course emphasises:
- **Understanding by doing** – every lecture links to coding or hand exercises.  
- **Bridging theory and practice** – from matrix operations to full neural networks.  
- **Interdisciplinary collaboration** – between AI and meteorology students.  
- **Open-source tools** – to encourage exploration beyond the classroom.
